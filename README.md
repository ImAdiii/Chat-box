# Chat-box

Of course! Here’s a clear and concise **description** and **“How to Run”** section you can add to your `README.md` file for your chatbox project:

---

### 💬 Project Description

This Chatbox is a real-time messaging application built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **EJS**, **MongoDB**, and front-end technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides a clean and interactive interface where users can send and receive messages seamlessly. Backend logic is powered by **RESTful APIs** that connect to MongoDB to store and retrieve chat data, ensuring persistent and organized communication. Whether you want to integrate it into a larger app or use it standalone, this chatbox is designed to be simple, responsive, and easy to set up.

### 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Project

#### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbox.git
cd chatbox
```

#### 2. **Set up MongoDB**

* Make sure you have **MongoDB** installed and running locally, or create a **MongoDB Atlas** account for a cloud-hosted database.
* For local MongoDB, the default connection string is:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chatbox
```

If using MongoDB Atlas, replace this URI with your Atlas connection string.

#### 3. **Create a `.env` file**

Create a file named `.env` in the project’s root and add:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

#### 4. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

#### 5. **Start the server**

```bash
npm start
```

#### 6. **Access the application**

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

That’s it — you can now use the chatbox! 🎉

> 💡 **Optional**
> If you want to customize the views or front-end styles, you can edit the `.ejs`, `.css`, and `.js` files inside the `views` and `public` directories.
